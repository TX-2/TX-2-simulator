# TX-2 Assembler

This program reads assembly language programs and produces files which
emulate punched tapes containing the program.

See the [TX-2 Assembler documentation](../docs/assembler) for more
information.

See [Getting Started with the
Assembler](../docs/assembler/getting-started.md) for a short tutorial
on using the assembler.
