# Debugging the Browser Based Emulator

The emulator produces logs debug information to the browser's
Javascript console log.

You should also be able to use your browser's development tools (for
example, [Chrome Dev
Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools) for Chrome) to set
breakpoints in the emulator, inspect data, and so on.
