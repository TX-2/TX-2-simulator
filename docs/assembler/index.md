# TX-2 Assembler

This is a cross-assembler, meaning that it runs on a modern computer.
It reads a [source file](input.md) and produces an [output which is a
tape image file suitable for booting the TX-2](output.md).

See [Getting Started with the Assembler](getting-started.md) for a
short tutorial on using the assembler and [Limitations](limitations)
for an explanation of the assembler's current limitations.
