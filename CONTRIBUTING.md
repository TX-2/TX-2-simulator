# TX-2 Contributor's Guide

First of all, thank you for contributing to the TX-2 project.

We hope to celebrate MIT Lincoln Lab's historic TX-2 computer and some
of the pioneeting software created for it by re-creating the computer
in the form of a simulator and making it possible to run that software
again.

This guide explains what kinds of contribution we're looking for and
explains how you can help.

## What Contributions are Needed?

Most of all, we need TX-2 software and documentation.  These either in
printed/scanned for or (even better) machine-readable form.  We're
hoping to get these from [MIT Lincoln Lab](https://www.ll.mit.edu/)
and from the people who worked on the TX-2.

We understand that some of these materials are unique and
irreplaceable.  You don't need to send them to us.  We could, for
example, ask some professional computing historians to help and/or ask
the [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/) to assist
(they've been very helpful in the past).  If you prefer to simply send
us an electronic version of the document you have, that works for us.

### Contributing by Programming

We also need help in implementing the instructions and machine
features we already have documentation for.  Some important things
that still need to be written are recorded in the [issues
list](https://github.com/TX-2/TX-2-simulator/issues).  Items which we
think are good choices for fist-time contributors are [marked with the
"good first issue"
tag](https://github.com/TX-2/TX-2-simulator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

The "good first issue" tags are marked that way mainly because they
implement a simple instruction and there is something in the existing
code to guide you.

If you are planning a significant contribution which doesn't already
have an issue, please create one and outline what you hope to do.

If you are unfamiliar with Github, or Git or Rust, please let us know
so that we can help you to get started.

### Guidelines for Code Contributions

- [ ] Contributions must use the [MIT
      license](https://github.com/TX-2/TX-2-simulator/blob/main/LICENSE-MIT).
- [ ] Please keep pull requests small, even if this means you don't
      fully implement the feature you have in mind in the first pull
      request.
