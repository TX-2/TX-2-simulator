# TX-2 Simulator

We are trying to create a simulator for Lincoln Lab's historic TX-2
computer. Notably, this is the computer on which Ivan Sutherland's
Sketchpad program ran. If we can get the simulator working, we may be
able to run Sketchpad once again.

From [the Wikipedia entry for the TX-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TX-2):

> The MIT Lincoln Laboratory TX-2 computer was the successor to the
> Lincoln TX-0 and was known for its role in advancing both artificial
> intelligence and humanâ€“computer interaction. Wesley A. Clark was the
> chief architect of the TX-2.

## Trying It Out

To get started with using the emulator, please read [Getting
Started](docs/getting-started.md).

## For More Information

There is [more documentation about the emulator and its tools](docs),
including a [Design Overview](docs/OVERVIEW.md). See also the [TX-2
Project's website](https://tx-2.github.io/).

## Contributing

If you are considering contributing, first of all, thanks!

We have quite a lot of [documentation about the operation and
programming of the TX-2](https://tx-2.github.io/documentation.html).
This is what our implementation is based on.

Please see our [Contributor's Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information
on what we need and how you can help. The Guide also explains what
non-coding contributions are needed and how to identify a good "first
issue" to pick up.
