# TX-2-Instruction-Simulator

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TX-2:

The MIT Lincoln Laboratory TX-2 computer was the successor to the
Lincoln TX-0 and was known for its role in advancing both artificial
intelligence and humanâ€“computer interaction. Wesley A. Clark was the
chief architect of the TX-2.

## To Build The Code

To be able to build the code, [install the Rust build
tools](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

## Trying It Out

The current simulator is not yet advanced enough to be interactive.
To try it out, simply run

```
cargo run
```

This will build the code (if necessary) and then run it.
